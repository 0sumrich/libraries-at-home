## About Libraries at home

Libraries at home is a site aimed at bringing together information about public library services in the UK, and making this easy to find and accessible.

The goal is not to create content, or replace the use of existing content or library websites. It is designed to provide a way of signposting library users to the information they are looking for, as quickly as possible.

### Help

A lot of effort went into initially compiling the data that makes this site possible. The websites for each library service in the UK (205) were checked to compile data on social media accounts, important links, library catalogue and eResource suppliers, and more.
